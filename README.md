# cpp-async

C++ 20 contains the core language support needed to make coroutines (async/await) possible, but it does not provide the
related types needed to write an actual coroutine or functions to consume coroutines in common ways. This repository
provides support types and functions to fill that gap, until such capabilities are made available as part of the C++
Standard Library.

# awaitable_get()

This function allows blocking the calling thread until an awaitable completes and returns the awaitable's value (or
void, as appropriate). It works with any awaitable type.

Example usage:
```c++
inline /*<some_awaitable_type>*/ run_async() { co_return; }

int main()
{
    async::awaitable_get(run_async());
}
```

```c++
inline /*<some_awaitable_type>*/ read_file_async()
{
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    co_return std::string{ "file contents" };
}

int main()
{
    std::string text{ async::awaitable_get(read_file_async()) };
    printf("%s\n", text.c_str());
}
```

# awaitable_then()

This function allows scheduling a single continuation to run when an awaitable completes. It provides a single argument
to the continuation, which, when invoked, returns the awaitable's (or void, as appropriate) if the awaitable succeeded
or throws if the awaitable failed. It works with any awaitable type.

If the provided continuation throws, await_then terminates the process. (A caller can avoid this behavior by surrounding
the continuation in a try/catch block.)

Example usage:
```c++
inline /*<some_awaitable_type>*/ read_file_async()
{
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    co_return std::string{ "file contents" };
}

int main()
{
    async::event_signal done{};
    async::awaitable_then(read_file_async(), [&done](awaitable_result<std::string> result)
        {
            printf("%s\n", result().c_str());
            done.set();
        });
    done.wait();
}
```

```c++
inline /*<some_awaitable_type>*/ read_file_async()
{
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    co_return std::string{ "file contents" };
}

std::future<std::string> read_file_future()
{
    std::shared_ptr<std::promise<std::string>> promise{ std::make_shared<std::promise<std::string>>() };
    async::awaitable_then(read_file_async(), [promise](awaitable_result<std::string> result)
        {
            try
            {
                promise->set_value(result());
            }
            catch (...)
            {
                promise->set_exception(std::current_exception());
            }
        });
    return promise->get_future();
}

int main()
{
    printf("%s\n", read_file_future().get().c_str());
}
```

# task<T>

This type is a coroutine return type; it allows writing a function as a coroutine (calling co_await/co_return).

task<T> supports the following return types:
* T is void
* T is a move-only type
* T is a type that does not have a default constructor
* T is a reference type

A caller may only co_await a task<T> once, and the result of the task is moved out when returning from co_await.

When working with the task<T> directly (rather than only passing it directly to co_await), a caller may cancel execution
of any code that would resume after the task completes by destructing the task. (Destructing the task does not stop the
task's coroutine from running, just any continuation that would run after the task's coroutine completes.) As a result,
an exception thrown from a task will be ignored if no caller consumes the task's result. (A caller can avoid this
behavior by consuming the task's result and handling the exception differently; for example by co_awaiting the task from
another coroutine and calling std::terminate when it throws.)

Internally, task<T> destroys the coroutine frame as soon as the coroutine completes; it does not wait until the task has
destructed (which would only be after executing any code that will run next). Both options here involve tradeoffs; the
alternative would avoid the need for an internal heap allocation when creating the task at the expense of keeping
(potentially large) coroutine frame memory in use longer.

Example usage:
```c++
inline async::task<void> do_async()
{
    /* do some work */
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    /* do some more work */
    co_return;
}
```

```c++
inline async::task<std::string> read_async()
{
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    co_return std::string{ "contents" };
}
```

```c++
inline async::task<std::unique_ptr<std::string>> return_move_only_async()
{
    co_return std::make_unique<std::string>("contents");
}

inline async::task<void> use_move_only_async()
{
    std::unique_ptr<std::string> text{ co_await return_move_only_async() };
    printf("%s\n", text->c_str());
}
```

```c++
inline async::task<int&> return_reference_type_async(int& a, int& b)
{
    int& larger{ a > b ? a : b };
    co_return larger;
}

inline async::task<void> use_reference_type_async()
{
    int first{ 3 };
    int second{ 6 };
    const int& larger{ co_await return_reference_type_async(first, second) };
    ++second;
    printf("%i\n", larger); // 7
}
```

```c++
inline async::task<void> fire_and_forget()
{
    /* do some work */

    co_await /* some awaitable object */;

    if (/* something bad happens*/)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error{ "fire_and_forget failed" };
    }

    co_return;
}

inline async::task<void> fire_and_forget_except_crash_on_failure()
{
    try
    {
        co_await fire_and_forget();
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::terminate();
    }
}

int main()
{
    {
        // uncomment one of the next lines (to ignore or crash on exception):
        //fire_and_forget();
        fire_and_forget_except_crash_on_failure();
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds{ 1 });
}
```

# task_completion_source<T>

This type controls a task and allows it to be returned and completed separately. Is is designed for producing an
awaitable type from a function that is not itself a coroutine.

The design of this type is intentionally similar to TaskCompletionSource<TResult> in .NET.

Example usage:
```c++
async::task<int> compute_async(std::thread& callbackThread)
{
    std::shared_ptr<async::task_completion_source<int>> promise{
        std::make_shared<async::task_completion_source<int>>() };
    // Warning: without the sleep below, the may run and be destroyed before it is assigned to callbackThread.
    // Capture the task_completion_source shared_ptr by value, or it will get destructed before the callbackThread runs.
    callbackThread = std::thread{ [promise]()
        {
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds{ 1 });
            promise->set_value(123);
        }
    };
    printf("Returning the task now; will complete it later... ");
    return promise->task();
}

int main()
{
    std::thread callbackThread{};
    printf("[completed]\nThe task returned %i\n", async::awaitable_get(compute_async(callbackThread)));
    callbackThread.join();
}
```

# to_future()

This function produces a std::future<T> for an awaitable; it downgrades a C++ 20 awaitable/coroutine to a C++ 11
std::future<T> (for use with legacy code).

This function works with any awaitable type whose return value type can be used with std::promise<T>. Note that types
without default constructors are not supported for std::promise<T>

Example usage:
```c++
inline /*<some_awaitable_type>*/ read_file_async()
{
    co_await /* some awaitable object */;
    co_return std::string{ "file contents" };
}

// Convert to legacy C++ 11 async; for example, if needed to defer refactoring the caller.
inline std::future<std::string> read_file_future()
{
    return async::to_future(read_file_async());
}

int main()
{
    std::string text{ read_file_future().get() };
    printf("%s\n", text.c_str());
}
```
